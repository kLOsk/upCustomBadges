Custom Badges Addon for User Pro WordPress Plugin

A very simple plugin that copies a selection of Badges to UserPro. It’s in a very early development stage, but does what needs to be done.

Instructions:

* Make sure to have UserPro (Premium plugin on CodeCanyon) installed and activated before installing the UserPro Custom Badges Plugin.
  * Buy it here: http://goo.gl/S1sOgz
* Install the Plugin and activate it
* Go to Settings -> UP Custom Badges
* Click Copy Badges, or Delete Badges to install the custom badge set. 
  * The Delete Badges function only deletes the Custom Badges. The stock badges won’t be deleted.
* Go to the User Pro Badges setting and be happy about your new badges

The functionality of the Buttons is very limited. You press them and nothing happens. But it will copy the badges in the Background. Not sure, why the AJAX confirmation doesn’t work. If someone knows how to fix this, please let me know.

Please Note: This is my first plugin. Please use at your own risk and let me know if you find bugs!
