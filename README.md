Custom Badges Addon for User Pro WordPress Plugin

I have created a very simple plugin that copies a selection of Badges to UserPro. It’s in a very early development stage, but does what needs to be done.

Instructions:

Make sure to have UserPro (Premium plugin on CodeCanyon) installed and activated before installing the UserPro Custom Badges Plugin
Install the Plugin and activate it
Go to Settings -> UP Custom Badges
Copy Badges, or Delete Badges to install the custom badge set. The Delete Badges function only deletes the Custom Badges. The stock badges won’t be deleted. The functionality of the Buttons is very limited. You basically press them and nothing happens. But it will copy the badges in the Background. Not sure, why the AJAX confirmation doesn’t work. If someone knows how to fix this, please let me know.
Go to the User Pro Badges Setting and see the badges

Please Note: This is my first plugin. Please use at your own risk and let me know if you find some bugs!
