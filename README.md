Custom Badges Addon for User Pro WordPress Plugin

A very simple plugin that copies a selection of Badges to UserPro.

Instructions:

* Make sure to have UserPro (Premium plugin on CodeCanyon) installed and activated before installing the UserPro Custom Badges Plugin.
  * Buy it here: http://goo.gl/S1sOgz
* Install the Plugin and activate it
* Go to Settings -> UP Custom Badges
* Click Copy Badges, or Delete Badges to install the custom badge set. 
  * The Delete Badges function only deletes the Custom Badges. The stock badges wonâ€™t be deleted.
* Go to the User Pro Badges setting and be happy about your new badges


Please Note: This is my first plugin. Please use at your own risk and let me know if you find bugs!

Changelog
=========

v1.0
The plugin should now work fully. It has an autoupdate mechanism included that triggers the WP update function, once I upload a new version here on GitHub. Neat, eh?
I also fixed the button feedback. They now tell you that everything went well! I will hunt for more badges and add them to the plugin. Enjoy!
